This is my Java project creating a "Prototype" GUI based application that works like M-BCA.

For convenience you'd better prepare these things first:
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [Unicode Based Power Button Font](https://unicodepowersymbol.com/font/)
* [JDatePicker](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/io.github.lzh0379/jdatepicker/2.0.3/source-code)
* (Optional) [Apache Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html)
